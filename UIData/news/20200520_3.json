Aurora's shares have gained 77% in the month to date.  \"As one of our observant colleagues pointed out: ACB's stock gained in value equivalent to twice that of OGI's entire market cap {about $250 million)-- or thrice that of Village Farms' market cap  (@178 million)--after reporting a net loss equivalent to about 50% of OGI's market cap, or 75% of VFF's. Let that sink in,\" the analysts wrote. Organigram and Village Farms are well operated companies that consistently report positive EBITDA and are capturing market share, said the note. Aurora shares were down 4.5% premarket  and are down 43% in the year to date, while the Cannabis ETF  has fallen 24% and the S&P 500  has fallen 10%.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures  fell more than 280 points, or 1.2%, and S&P 500 futures  and Nasdaq-100 futures  declined as well. Apple  and Amazon  reported earnings after the market closed, with Apple reporting a dip in profits but growing sales, but the tech giant said it would not give third-quarter guidance due to uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Amazon beat analysts' earnings estimates, but warned it might lose money in the current quarter as it ramps up spending to deal with the pandemic. Both companies' stock fell in the extended session. Earlier in the day, U.S. stocks ended lower as investors weighed mixed corporate earnings and a report that the Trump administration was considering retaliating against China for its handling of the coronavirus. Still, for the month, the Dow  gained 11.1%, while the S&P 500  ended up 12.7%, representing their best monthly gains since 1987 and their best April performances since 1938, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq  ended up 15.5%, its best monthly advance since 2000 and its best April on record.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

"<p>Shares of Amazon.com Inc.  rallied 2.2% in morning trading Wednesday, after Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter raised his stock price target close to the fourth highest on Wall Street, a week before the e-commerce giant reports first-quarter earnings. Pachter reiterated his outperform rating and lifted his price target by 18% to $2,750, which is 16% above current levels. \"Consumers are clearly spending more of their time and money shopping online in order to avoid crowds, driving the supply shortages and delivery delays on non-essential items that Amazon has disclosed in recent weeks,\" Pachter wrote in a note to clients. He said while consumers may be disappointed that Amazon hasn't effectively managed the increased demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic, he views the unexpected surge in demand to be a \"high-class problem.\" Amazon is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 30. Pachter is now the fourth-most bullish of the 47 analysts surveyed by FactSet, Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group and Brent Thill of Jefferies, who have $2,800 stock price targets, and Chaim Seigel of Elazar Advisors, who has a $2,788 price target. Amazon's stock has run up 29% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has lost 18%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

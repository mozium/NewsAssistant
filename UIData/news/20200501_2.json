Adjusted per-share earnings came to 80 cents, compared with the FactSet consensus of 73 cents. Pfizer reported $12.0 billion in revenue in the first months of the year, down 8% from the $13.1 billion it reported in the same quarter a year ago.  The FactSet consensus was for $11.8 billion. The company said it had a $150 million lift in the quarter that can be attributed to an 11% increase in global sales of its hospital products (some of which are used to intubate and support patients on mechanical ventilators) and a 29% jump in sales of its blood-thinner Eliquis, which was driven by COVID-19-related wholesaler purchases. It also restarted some clinical trials and launched new studies in late April after pausing some in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pfizer reaffirmed its 2020 revenue guidance of $48.5 billion to $50.5 billion in 2020 and it also reaffirmed adjusted EPS  of $2.82 to $2.92 for the year.

The JAMA Network Open, in a peer-reviewed report, recommended that the use of chloroquine, touted by President Donald Trump, shouldn't be used for the treatment of severe COVID-19, based on preliminary findings. A study of the drug was cut short because the primary outcome of the treatment in higher doses was death, the JNO report showed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was trading down 0.2% at 23,475, but had touched a low at 23,417, while the S&P 500 index  was virtually unchanged at 2,799 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  was holding on to a gain of 0.2%. The markets have been on edge this week as investors look for upbeat signs that the U.S. will be able to emerge from lockdowns and stay-at-home procedures but in place to limit the spread of the deadly contagion. Earlier, the Food and Drug Administration also warned against using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine outside a hospital or formal clinical trial setting.Corrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this article misidentified the medical publication that authored the report on anti-malarial drugs. The report was from the JAMA Network Open, an open access medical journal published by the American Medical Association. The Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, is a separate peer-reviewed medical journal. MarketWatch apologizes for the error. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

He said he had not cleared the temporary relocation of his family from London to a cottage on his parents' property in Durham with the prime minister, who himself was later hospitalized with a severe case of the coronavirus-borne disease COVID-19. He said he didn't regret the move and has not offered to resign nor considered such an offer. Cummings cited his wife's illness and child-care imperatives as motivating factors. As his wife's condition improved in Durham, he said, he became ill, as did his 4-year-old son, who ultimately was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where he spent the night but tested negative for COVID-19. Cummings said neither he nor his wife was ever tested. He said an uncle's death from the cororonavirus-borne disease did not affect his decisions or actions, nor did he and his family have contact with the now-deceased family member. Asked by a reporter whether his actions suggested there were two sets of rules, one for the powerful and one for others, he said he felt lockdown restrictions allowed exceptions for those caring for small children. He said that, contrary to speculation, he was a supporter rather than an opponent of the U.K's lockdown policy.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

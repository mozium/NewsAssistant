The report was compiled from informtion obtained as of March 12. Wages - some 70% of employment costs  - rose 0.9% in the first quarter. Benefits increased 0.4%, according to the government's closely followed employment cost index. In the 12 months ended in March employment costs increased at an unadjusted 2.8%. The ECI reflects how much companies, governments and nonprofit institutions pay their employees in wages and benefits. What the report showed before the pandemic was that the labor market was very healthy, but it's unclear how employment costs will be affected in the second quarter. Compensation could actually rise since more low-wage workers than high-wage employees have lost their jobs. Or the growth in wages and benefits could both decline sharply. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Musk has been a vocal critic of the shutdown orders, last week going as far as calling them \"fascist.\" Local health authorities on Friday foiled Tesla's plans to start reopening the factory, clarifying that, despite the reopening of some nonessential businesses elsewhere in the state, their own shutdown order prevailed.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

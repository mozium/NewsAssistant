The maker of vehicle seats and electronic systems said net income dropped to $76.4 million, or $1.26 a share, from $228.9 million, or $3.73 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share fell to $2.05 from $4.00, but was above the FactSet consensus of $1.33. Revenue fell 13.6% to $4.46 billion, as COVID-19 shaved and estimated $900 million from revenue, but still beat the FactSet consensus of $4.22 billion. The company said it was not providing a full-year outlook given the significant uncertainty associated with the pandemic. \"Our first quarter financial results were significantly impacted by production disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Chief Executive Ray Scott. \"We experienced plant shutdowns in China beginning in late January that were followed by shutdowns of almost all our global operations outside of China beginning in mid- to late-March.\" The stock, which is still inactive in premarket trading, had dropped 23.8% over the  past three months, while the S&P 500  has lost 13.4%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.91 from $1.62 and topped the FactSet consensus of $1.62. Revenue rose 8.3% to $66.76 billion to beat the FactSet consensus of $64.08 billion, as revenue for the pharmacy services, retail and long-term care and health care benefits businesses all rose above expectations. The pharmacy businesses benefit from greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills amid the COVID-19 pandemic and retail benefit from increased store volume as consumers prepared for COVID-19 related lockdowns. CVS affirmed its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.04 to $7.17, which is above the current FactSet consensus of $7.02.

the coronavirus, and they say that one mutation may put people at risk for a second infection with another mutated version of the virus, according to a preprint shared by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. A preprint is a type of preliminary report that has not been peer-reviewed and is not considered factual. The D614 mutation, which may be replacing the original Wuhan version of the virus, may also heighten the risk of a second infection and may be associated with higher rates of transmissibility. \"Increased infectivity would be consistent with rapid spread,\" the researchers wrote. In the early weeks of the pandemic, the D614 mutation was the most common form of the virus, with exceptions in Italy and Switzerland; however, throughout March, a form of the virus with the G614 mutation began to dominate. The mutations followed a similar path in the U.S., Canada, and some other countries, starting with the D614 form and then a rapid rise of the G614 mutation, which carries a higher viral load in patients. \"The D614 form was the dominant local form early in the epidemic. Wherever G614 entered a population, a rapid rise in its frequency followed, and in many cases G614 became the dominant local form in a matter of only a few weeks,\" they wrote. The researchers also said it's unclear why the D614 version of the virus is replacing the original virus. \"We do not know what is driving this selective sweep,\" they concluded.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

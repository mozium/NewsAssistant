The move comes after USO lost one-third of its value in the most recent week amid a worsening global oil glut. USO, which directly tracks oil futures contracts, had earlier attempted to mitigate losses by stretching out its exposure to later-dated oil futures contracts, but on Tuesday said it would abandon a pre-set strategy and invest in contracts in \"any month available.\" On Tuesday, USO had to stop creating new fund shares after it reached a pre-determined threshold of exposure to the underlying securities. By reducing the number of USO shares outstanding, USO's post-split shares will be valued eight times higher than pre-split shares. The step will be completed April 28. USO shares have lost about 78% of their value in the year to date, and many analysts believe retail investors have borne most of those losses in recent weeks. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

So far this month, USO has lost more than one-third of its value, as oversupply and a lack of places to store crude have delivered a body blow to the energy complex. Fund managers of USO have taken steps to staunch the losses, including smoothing the portfolio's exposure to oil contracts of different months, and engineering an 8-for-1 reverse stock split that will take effect April 28.

market-related writedown, and revenue that fell 12%, as the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted demand, resulting in oversupplied market and \"unprecedented\" pressure on commodity prices. The stock fell 1.9% in premarket trading. The oil giant reported a net loss of $610 million, or 14 cents a share, after net income of $2.35 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding a $2.9 billion charge, which reflected the valuation impacts from lower commodity prices and asset impairments, adjusted earnings per share fell to 53 cents from 55 cents. Revenue fell to $56.16 billion from $63.63 billion a year ago, and from $67.17 billion in the sequential fourth quarter. The FactSet consensus for EPS was 1 cent and for revenue was $53.5 billion. Exxon said it was reducing 2020 capital spending by 30% to $23 billion, and its operating expenses by 15%. The company said its objective during the COVID-19 crisis is to \"continue investing in industry-advantaged projects to create value, preserve cash for the dividend, and make appropriate use of its balance sheet.\" The stock has dropped 33.4% year to date through Thursday, while crude oil futures  have shed 69.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has declined 14.7%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

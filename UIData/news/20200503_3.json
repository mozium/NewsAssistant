Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average   were off 288 points, or 1.2%, at 23,331, those for the S&P 500 index   declined 31.45 points, or 1%, at 2,790.25, while Nasdaq-100 futures  retreated 88.25 points, or 1%, at 8,629.75. More than two dozen U.S. have begun to allow select businesses to open or announce plans to do in May, but local and federal officials are also facing climbing cases of novel cases of coronavirus, albeit, at a slower pace. The COVID-19 pandemic has killed nearly 250,000 people world-wide and infected 3.5 million, with 1.154 million in the U.S. alone, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, investors may pay close attention to the airline industry after Warren Buffett, during an annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, said that his Berkshire Hathaway   had sold all of its stake in major airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc. , Southwest Airlines , United Airlines-parent United Airlines Holdings Inc.  and American Airlines . On Friday, the Dow fell 622.03 points, or 2.6%, to end at 23,723.69, while the S&P 500 gave up 81.72 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 2,830.71.

The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 522 points, or 2.2%, at 24,620, the S&P 500 index  rose 2.6% at 2,937, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  climbed 3.4% at 8,895. In a statement following its two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank said: \"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\" The Fed kept its benchmark rate close to a range of 0% and 0.25% and repeated it would hold policy steady until the economy has weathered recent events and \"is on track\" to achieve full employment and price stability. That is unchanged from the March forward guidance. The Fed has already reduced a key interest rate to near zero and increased its balance sheet to $6.6 trillion, adding $2.2 trillion over the course of the past few weeks, as it doled out funds to help prop up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic.

A benchmark of small-capitalization stocks, the Russell 2000 index  surged more than 5%, highlighting an area of the market that has made a powerful surge higher after being badly left behind during the coronavirus-induced rout in March, which hurt small businesses the most. Helping set the stage for gains on the day was a host of data from Gilead Sciences , which showed that its anti-malarial drug remdesivir was successful in treating certain patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the New York Times on Wednesday reported that the Food and Drug Administration is preparing to grant an emergency-use authorization as early as Wednesday. That news came after a series of data points from clinical trials were shared publicly, including promising results of a Gilead-sponsored trial, a positive preliminary data analysis from a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study, and data from a Chinese clinical trial published in The Lancet. Meanwhile, the Fed kept interest rates at a range of 0% and 0.25% but said that it intends on doing whatever is necessary to help support an economy and market beleaguered by the viral outbreak.    </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The JAMA Network Open, in a peer-reviewed report, recommended that the use of chloroquine, touted by President Donald Trump, shouldn't be used for the treatment of severe COVID-19, based on preliminary findings. A study of the drug was cut short because the primary outcome of the treatment in higher doses was death, the JNO report showed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was trading down 0.2% at 23,475, but had touched a low at 23,417, while the S&P 500 index  was virtually unchanged at 2,799 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  was holding on to a gain of 0.2%. The markets have been on edge this week as investors look for upbeat signs that the U.S. will be able to emerge from lockdowns and stay-at-home procedures but in place to limit the spread of the deadly contagion. Earlier, the Food and Drug Administration also warned against using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine outside a hospital or formal clinical trial setting.Corrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this article misidentified the medical publication that authored the report on anti-malarial drugs. The report was from the JAMA Network Open, an open access medical journal published by the American Medical Association. The Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, is a separate peer-reviewed medical journal.

The FT said that researchers studied 237 patients, giving the drug to 158 and comparing their progress with the remaining 79. The story indicated that the drug showed significant side effects in some, with 18 patients taken off it. A WHO spokesperson told Stat that the manuscript is undergoing peer review and was published by accident. Earlier this month Chinese authorities had halted two trials for remdesivir, saying that there weren't enough patients to fully enroll the studies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was bouncing around in afternoon action, well of its highs, and was trading up 123 points, or 0.5%, at 23,589, the S&P 500 index  was up 0.5% at 2,812, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 0.6% at 8,551. Meanwhile, shares of Gilead were down nearly 4% Thursday. A report last week from Stat News indicated that remdesivir was seeing some success but the research linked to that report was not based on a clinical study.  A Gilead spokesperson was quoted as saying in Stat that reports of the research \"included inappropriate characterization of the study.\"  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

After the regular session the U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved a nearly $500 billion aid package for small businesses and hospitals hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, setting up a vote in the House of Representatives as President Donald Trump threw his support behind the measure. Trump, during a Tuesday evening news briefing centered on the country's response to the coronavirus epidemic, said that he would aim to ban immigration for a 60-day period, citing a need to focus on \"American workers\" after the pandemic hurt business activity. In regular trade Tuesday, the Dow  fell 631.56 points, or 2.7%, at 23,018, the S&P 500 index  lost 86.60 points, or 3.1%, to close at 2,736.56, with both benchmarks finishing at their lowest levels since April 7, according to FactSet data.
